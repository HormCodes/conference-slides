## Each X has own Y

    line [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]
```

<!--
the main thing to remember is to write pure functions or methods

each input has the same output

In FP language, this means we would like to avoid side effects

comparison with OOP

let's take look at more practical example
-->

---

````md magic-move
```js
let reveiws = ["4/5 - Solid place to spend a night!"]

function addReview({ rating, comment }) {
  reveiws = [...reveiws, `${rating}/5 - ${comment}`]
}

addReview({rating: 1, comment: "Found bugs :/"})
```

```js
let reveiws = ["4/5 - Solid place to spend a night!"]

function addReview({ reviews, rating, comment }) {
  return [...reveiws, `${rating}/5 - ${comment}`]
}

reveiws = addReview({rating: 1, comment: "Found bugs :/"})
```

```js
const reveiws = ["4/5 - Solid place to spend a night!"]

function addReview({ reviews, rating, comment }) {
  return [...reviews, `${rating}/5 - ${comment}`]
}

const updatedReviews = addReview({rating: 1, comment: "Found bugs :/"})
```
````

<!--
imagine we have an application for storing interesting places and writing reviews

you can see we have a function for adding a review

you can also see we override the reviews

in FP, this is a side effect

we can make it more functional (refactoring) and return new instead of overriding

or even further and just create a new variable

... so if I go back...

<!--
we need to make sure X and Y

it can run multiple times

you can see exceptions in the chart

but overall this is really good for testing

which type of input do I need to cover?

<!--
if we go back to our example

we have our pure function

# Data, Calculations, Actions üßë‚Äçüíª

... concept by Eric Normand

<!--
splitting code into 3 categories

Actions - things do not want to run multiple times

(modifying variables, logs, sending email)

Calculations - functions with inputs matching exact outputs (no matter when we call them)

(mathematical operations, string templates, data constructor)


Data is just data - inputs (numbers to multiply, email)

but also hard-coded rules (unit conversion rules etc.)
-->

---

```js {all|3,8,14,17|10,11,19,20|all}
function createPlace({place}) {
  // ...
  validatePlace(place)
  // ...
  console.log("user created place");
}

function validatePlace({ name, photos }) {
  if (name === '') {
      console.log("user passed invalid name");
      throw Error("name cannot be empty")
  }
  
  photos.forEach(photo => validatePhoto(photo))
}

function validatePhoto({url}) {
  if (!url.startsWith("https://")) {
    console.log("user passed invalid name");
    throw Error("url needs to start with https")
  }
}
```

<!--
back to our example and to see how does it help us

we can see we have validation

we log and we throw, it does matter when and it can surprise us

let's apply functional refactoring
-->

---

```js {none|14-25|0-13|all}
function createPlace({ place }) {
  // ...
  const validationErrors = validatePlace(place)

  if (validationErrors.length !== 0) {
    console.log(`user passed invalid place: ${validationErrors}`)
    throw Error(validationErrors)
  }

  // ...
  console.log("user created place");
}

function validatePlace({ name, photos }) {
  return [
    ...(name !== '' ? [] : ["name cannot be empty"]),
    ...(photos.map(photo => validatePhoto(photo)).flat())
  ]
}

function validatePhoto({ url }) {
  return [
    ...(url.startsWith("https://") ? [] : ["url needs to start with https"])
  ]
}
```

<!--
instead of throwing we can return the result

in this case, the list of errors as strings

we transformed some input (data and calculations)

and by the end, we do action and log and throw
-->

---

```js {all|0-3|5,9,14-17|6-7,10-11,19-21|all}
function createPlace({ place, database }) {
  const validationErrors = validatePlace(place)
  const exists = database.get(place.name)

  if (validationErrors.length !== 0) {
    console.log(`user passed invalid place: ${validationErrors}`)
    throw Error(validationErrors)
  }
  if (exists) {
    console.log(`user tried to create existing place ${place.name}`)
    throw Error(`place ${place.name} already exists`)
  }

  const created = {
    ...place,
    id: randomId()
  }

  database.upsert(created)
  console.log("user created place");
  return created
}
```

<!--
more complete example

how does it help us? simple change surprise in another place

this structure helps us to be consistent and be more predictable

it also helps with debugging

tests, came to conclusion that are not enough

we can be more flexible (generating ID, upsert)
-->

---

# New way to structure code

We can start applying this structure to any type of codebase...

<v-click>

````md magic-move
```js
function createPlace({ place, database }) {
  // ...
  database.upsert(created)
  console.log("user created place");
  return created
}
```

```js
function createPlace({ place, database, eventBus }) {
  // ...
  database.upsert(created)
  eventBus.publish({type: "create", value: created})
  console.log("user created place");
  return created
}
```
````

</v-click>

<!--
good refactoring practice, immidiate benefits

this new structure allows us to be more flexible with the actions

for example adding new storage
-->

---

# Extending our inputs and outputs

````md magic-move
```js
describe('createPlace', () => {
  it('should create place and store in database for valid input', () => {
    // ...
  });

  it('should throw an errror for invalid input', () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

```js
describe('createPlace', () => {
  it('should create place and store in database for valid input', () => {
    // ...
  });

  it('should throw an errror for invalid input', () => {
    // ...

  it('should throw an error if place with same name exists', () => {

# Tidy-First Practice üßΩ

... Concept by Kent Beck

<!--
about distiunguish structural and behaviour changes

work in a way how can we prepare the code base

to make the change easy and then make the change

invest in structure

the opposite is rewrite

tidy instead of refactoring

small PRs merged faster, deployable PR

not be blocked by waiting for a review

let's take a look at more practical example
-->

---

# Small and safe PRs

When adding a new feature to existing legacy code...

1. Multiple PRs adding test coverage
2. Multiple PRs refactoring legacy code
3. PR adding utils for the feature
4. Adding feature code without showing to user
5. Multiple PRs improving feature and tests
6. Small PR enabling it

<!--
adding a new feature to legacy code is quite common

instead of asap, invest appropriate time

.... explain

sometimes it is good to also prototype a bit

what is good to refactor
-->

---
layout: center
---

# Extreme Programming üî•

<!--
we can go to extreme

do we need really PR if all changes are atomic? 

Kent is author

I don't have experience

Code reviews are good but we can inspire from it
-->

---
layout: center
---

## ‚ùå Not about making everything generic

<br>

## ‚ùå Not about spending all the time on refactoring

<!--
architecture guidelines things about isolation

no interfaces, encapsulation, etc.

we still should deliver features

using common sense
refactor at the right time

managers like soft release, incremental update, less risk
-->

---

# Compatible with functional thinking üôå

We can invest in...

- Make data structures more flexible and easy to use
- Optimise and make calculations more readable
- Prepare actions and enable them at the right time

<!--
and on top of that, it goes well

We can invest in data structures and calculations

is it difficult to access specific information?

Are our calculations fast enough? 

For example, adding a new property
-->

---
layout: center
---

# New features with minimal change ‚úÖ

<!--
and it will get some to get used to this

you will still get some things that will be hard

but then I always think of

OK, what do we need to fix here?

And in the end I end up with solution that is easy to release but also rollback
